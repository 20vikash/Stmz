### Concept of this app : A STEM app that is useful for learning.

## Key Features :

- Without concentrating much on a single stem topic, this app covers pretty much the entire stem.. How?
- This app has 2 modes.. "Learning" and "Playing Quiz"
- Currently, the data for learning has been fetched from multiple API's.. Example : NASA, number API..
- Unlike other quiz, you are not just bored with answering some existing questions.. You can create your own STEM quiz under a topic and others can answer. And obviously you can play quizes posted by other users..
- Is that everything it? No.
- You will be rewarded with 10 points for creating a quiz and you'll be gaining 3 points for every questions you answer correctly.
- You can check your total points in the leaderboard.

## What's not possible ?

- You cannot answer your own quiz and gain points..
- You can only gain points by answering a quiz created by a user only once.. The next time you take his/her quiz your points will not be updated.
